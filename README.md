# flutter_pagination

This project is based on [**JSONPlaceholder API**](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) which fetch number of posts based on the
number of page.



## Pagination

The concept of pagination is instead of fetching all the data that has the **same type** at once it will load 
a specific number of data based on the number of page.

### Understanding Pages

Page is a certain call that hits a specific endpoint to load number of data specified by the API.

#### For Example

calling this endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_page=2] will fetch all the data stored
in **page number 2**

But you can specify the number of data per page by giving the endpoint a number of data per page .

### For Example

calling this endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_page=2&_limit=5] will fetch
only **5 elements per page**.
